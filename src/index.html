  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>Hi, I'm Wes. I'm a full stack developer currently living in the Midlands. </p>
  <p>I've worked as a web designer and more recently completed a full-stack developer boot camp at Le Wagon, London.</p>
  <p>I'll be adding some of the projects I've been building here soon but in the meantime, <a href="/blogs">check out my blogs</a> to see what I've been up to.</p>

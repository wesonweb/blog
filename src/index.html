    <p>Hi, I'm Wes. I'm a full stack developer currently living in the Midlands. </p>
    <p>I've worked as a front end web developer and a British Sign Language interpreter. More recently I completed a full-stack developer bootcamp at Le Wagon, London.</p>
    <p>I've created this space to show some of the projects I'm working on &mdash; I'll be adding more soon. You can learn more about me in my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wes-mehaffy/">Linkedin profile</a> or by checking out <a href="https://github.com/wesonweb">my Github account</a>.</p>

        <p>Be sure to <a href="/blogs">take a look at my blogs</a> to see what I've been up to.</p>

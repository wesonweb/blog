<p>I've been meaning for a long time to get around to blogging but, as so often happens, things got in the way and, well, you know.</p>

<p>What I have learned is that you have to <strong>make</strong> time for things otherwise they just fall further down the waiting list. So, here I am.</p>

<h2>So, what's to come?</h2>
<p>I'm currently working on some web projects using the MERN stack. I'd like to share some of the things I've learned so far and some of the gotchas in the hope that they'll be useful to others, too. That's assuming anyone actually finds this and spends time reading it!</p>
<p>I'm also a keen gardener so expect some tips and updates on what I'm growing in my greenhouse.</p>
<p>Ok, that's enough for now. I'll see you on the next one!</p>

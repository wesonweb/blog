<p>I've been meaning for a long time to get around to blogging but, as so often happens, I never had the time and other more pressing things took over.</p>

<p>What I have learned is that you have to <strong>make</strong> time otherwise things never happen. So, here I am.</p>

<h2>What will I write about?</h2>
<p>I'm currently working on some web projects using the MERN stack. I'd like to share some of the things I've learned so far and some of the gotchas in the hope that they'll be useful to others, too. That's assuming anyone actually finds this and spends time reading it!</p>
<p>I'm a keen gardening so I'll probably chuck in some tips and updates on what I'm growing in my greenhouse.</p>
<p>Ok, that's enough for now. I'll see you on the next one!</p>

<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

<p>Deploying a full stack web-app is something I did during my Le Wagon bootcamp using Heroku. I found the developer
experience using it quite good. Seeing as Heroku have axed the free/hobby tier I decided to look at what else is out there and decided to give <a href="https://render.com/">Render</a> a go.</p>
<h2>Getting started with Render</h2>
<p>The first step is to ensure the app is a repository on Github. You can create the server and client sides as separate
repos and deploy them separately but my app is a mono-repo with both client and server sides in the one repo. Render
lets you select the repo and the branch that you wish to deploy from. I chose main.</p>
<p>I set the root directory as ./server and added the build command <code>npm i && cd ../client && npm i && npm run build</code> which
would install the relevant dependencies listed in the <code>package.json</code> file and then cd into the client folder and run the command <code>npm run build</code> which
creates the <code>/dist</code> folder with the prepared Vite app index.html and assets.</p>
<p>Render asks for the start command - <code>npm run start</code> - which starts the server running.</p>
<p>While my app isn’t using a database there are keys that are stored as environment variables and Render has a section to enter these as key value pairs. </p>
<p>Once the commands and values are entered it’s as simple as clicking on deploy to deploy the web app.</p>
<p>Cards on the table - it took me quite a few attempts to get it right. I encountered failed builds, deployments that
seemed to have gone live but threw an error when trying to view the site. Viewing the logs Render provides was useful in
trying to debug what was happening.
</p>
<p>What’s nice is that when any changes are pushed to the main branch will be automatically deployed.</p>

<h2>It's working!..or not...</h2>
<p>The app ran as expected on Chrome on my Mac browser but when I tested it on iOS Chrome I couldn’t get any results when
submitting a location. Initially I thought it might be an issue with the form submission. I considered it might be a quirk of iOS browsers and that it might require a button to trigger the form submission. I tried, and it didn't.</p>
<p>My next attempt at debugging was to test the site in a different browser on my mac - Safari. Same result -
no weather results. Opening dev tools shed a bit more light on the issue - I spotted a
console error: <code>Fetch API cannot load due to access control checks</code>.</p>
<p>After a bit of digging I realised that the <code>POST</code> request to the server was using the local server url http://localhost:8800 which worked perfectly when developing locally (and Chrome on the Mac seemed to forgive this on the deployed app) but Safari (and iOS browsers) would not fetch data from a url deemed unsafe.</p>
<p>I managed to fix this by creating an environment variable for local use only - <code>env.local</code> - which would store the local url and then within Render's environment variable section update it with the live url.</p>
<p> Bingo. It worked.</p>
<h2>Learnings</h2>
<p>Definitely a valuable learning experience, even though it was frustrating at times!</p>
<p>I will explore further the use of environment variables for local and production use and try to integrate them more in future projects.</p>
